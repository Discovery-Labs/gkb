# Grant 有哪些需要遵循的守则?

任何可以转换为 USDT** **的捐款都将在一个有效的匹配回合中被匹配。它将被匹配为来自一个新的独特的贡献者提供的。

1. 它来自一个新的身份，以前没有贡献过。
2. 该身份要求继续发展，但对于第五轮来说，一个独特的身份 = 比 CLR 轮更早的 Github 账户。
3. 身份要求需要该贡献与反女巫攻击或串通账号无关。

**We define collusion per the CLR Paper (** [**https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06421.pdf** ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06421.pdf)**) as**

**" The central vulnerabilities of LR, as with other mechanisms designed based on the assumption of unilateral optimization, are collusion and fraud. Collusion takes place when multiple agents act in their mutual interest to the detriment of other participants. Fraud takes place when a single citizen misrepresents herself as many. "**

**To call one case out specifically due to confusion in previous rounds, please avoid any form of quid pro quo that has financial value (a scenario in which a user gets some additional unique benefit/award in return for their donation).**

**We define a Sybil attack (** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack) **) per**

**" In a Sybil attack, the attacker subverts the reputation system of a network service by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence. It is named after the subject of the book Sybil, a case study of a woman diagnosed with a dissociative identity disorder. "**

**Some definite examples of rule-breaking:**

**1. DO NOT offer anyone a quid-pro-quo (especially one that has financial value) for a contribution.**

**2. DO NOT make up a new identity to contribute.**

**3. DO NOT try to falsify a contribution.**

**We cannot possibly enumerate every single literal example of a breaking of the above rule, so please treat the above list as an incomplete list. You should refer to the definitions of Sybil and collusion attack in the CLR paper as the canonical source of truth for the rules.**

**Rule violations can lead to a reduction, or nullification, of your matching bonus.**

**Any rule violations can be flagged via the ‘Flag Grant’ functionality on the Grants UI. For transparency, we tweet about rule violations at** [**https://twitter.com/GitcoinDisputes**](https://twitter.com/GitcoinDisputes) **– so follow that account if you’re interested in participating in that governance process.**
