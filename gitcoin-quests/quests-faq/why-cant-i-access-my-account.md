# 为什么不能访问我的账户？

Gitcoin 有许多产品和功能，为了正常工作，需要用户以诚实和诚信行事。否则，他们很容易受到女巫攻击。

出于该原因，Gitcoin 会根据我们认为的恶意行为封锁用户账户。Gitcoin 去中心化的一部分包括创建一个上诉程序，可以由我们的社区管理人进行裁决。

这个过程目前正在进行中。如果你认为你的账户被不公平地封锁了，请填写以下内容：[上诉请求表](https://forms.gle/eh5pDTWiYFFA3BCf8)。

Here are some of the reasons why your account may be blocked:

* Users who have been found violating our terms of service by creating multiple accounts
* Users who have posted racist, sexist, or otherwise offensive content
* Users who have engaged in harrassing other Gitcoin users
* Users who have been found violating our terms of service by engaging in impersonation or fraud

This is not an exhaustive list, simply the most common reasons. The Gitcoin team is responsible for creating a safe environment for users to work for the open internet and fund public goods. Our decisions are for the betterment of the ecosystem as a whole. By decentralizing Gitcoin, we will turn the power of account mediation back to the community through a transparent and politically decentralized appeal process. Please be patient with our team while the community figures out how to conduct this process.
