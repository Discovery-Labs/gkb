**我们的承诺**

为了促进一个开放和受欢迎的环境，作为贡献者和维护者，我们承诺使 Gitcoin 和我们的社区没有骚扰，无论年龄、体型、是否残疾、种族、性别特征、性别认同和表达、经验水平、教育、社会经济地位、国籍、个人外表、种族、宗教或性认同和性取向，都平等对待。

**我们的标准**

以下是一些有助于创造一个积极的环境的行为的例子：

* 使用受欢迎和具有包容性的语言
* 尊重不同的观点和经历
* 虚心地接受有建设性的意见
* 专注做对社区最有利的事情
* 对其他社区成员有共情能力

参与者不可接受的行为的例子包括：

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

**Our Responsibilities**

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

**Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

**Enforcement**

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at founders@gitcoin.co. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
