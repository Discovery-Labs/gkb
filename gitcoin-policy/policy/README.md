### Introduction



* The Gitcoin Mission

* What We Are Protecting

* Why Quadratic Funding Through Gitcoin Grants Matters

* Red Team vs Blue Team

* Legitimacy as a North Star for Gitcoin Grants
* Gitcoin Grants Platform and Technology

* Governance
  * Credible Neutrality

    Participation in Gitcoin Grants takes place on several abstraction layers, and each layer is governable. Since the end goal is governance entirely by the Community Stewards, we’ll need to decentralize governance of each layer, from the bottom up.

    Here are the efforts taken for Grants Round 10

    Grants Round 10 saw governance play a large role. The Anti-Fraud Workstream developed oversight practices for the review of new grants and the adjudication of disputes.

    1. We use the [@GitcoinDisputes](https://twitter.com/GitcoinDisputes) Twitter handle to communicate to and seek feedback from the community as we spot potential attacks.
    2. We employ an [open & community driven data analysis process](https://twitter.com/tecmns/status/1371451763820171270) driven by BlockScience and the Token Engineering Commons through the [Anti-Fraud Workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-anti-fraud-workstream-assemble/158).
    3. Prior to GR10, the Gitcoin Community Stewards [ratified round sizes](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmRbuBUX7vtNhYwYqYG3Jd4LqaRXVM8qDgjNojGEAzJdnH) through snapshot vote.
    4. Through a Snapshot vote the [Gitcoin Community Stewards ratified the creation of a new round](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmZTskr6yb4tSF7Jnnvd5a2YsuJJBDveEv4hbK6QJM83SB) \(Building Gitcoin\), and accepted $50K from Gitcoin Holdings to fund it.
    5. Through the Anti-Fraud Workstream, the community created a process of governing suspected fraudulent users and grants. As follows:

  * Steward's Role

    The Gitcoin Governance ecosystem is a delegated voting system \(liquid democracy\) which allows token holders to delegate their voting power to someone else. Community members who have had tokens delegated to them are Stewards, and may vote in on/off chain governance proposals. Token holders may delegate their voting power to themselves if they wish to participate as Stewards. Stewards who alone or with a group meet quorum \(1mm token supply\) may submit governance proposals that call for a vote.

  * Accepting Workstreams
  * Subjective Decisions
  * Making Policy Updates
  * Accepting Round Results

    Gitcoin uses quadratic funding to determine matching pool allocation to individual grants. This is a combination of the Quadratic Funding Algorithm, Pairwise matching, and Trust Bonus. But ultimately ratifying the round payouts is governed by the Community Stewards through a governance proposal and Snapshot vote. The payout transaction is then initiated by the multisig holders. In the future, the ratification vote will occur on-chain, and will trigger the payout transaction directly from the DAO’s treasury.
* GitcoinDAO Role in Grants
* Collection Levels & Participation Policies

  Think of the Platform as all of the grants that exist. If a grant is not allowed on the platform, it won't be approved for matching in any collection.

  There are two primary types of collections. They

  1. **Ecosystem** - Subset of "All Grants on Platform". Has it's own matching pool & policy.
  2. **Discovery** - Subset of grants in an Ecosystem. Can be given its own matching if the ecosystem allows for it.
     * **Sub-Rounds** like Infra, Dapp, Community are Discovery collections in the Ethereum ecosystem which are allocated a portion of the total matching for the round.
     * **User Collections** can be made by any user to highlight grants they think need to be supported.

  * Ecosystem Acceptance

    A subset of grants supported by a continuous matching pool. The ecosystem establishes their own norms & values.

    To use the Gitcoin Grants platform, the GitcoinDAO must approve of the ecosystem who is providing matching funding to a self-curated collection of grants. **This requires ratification by Steward Vote.**

    The Ethereum ecosystem is the one our quarterly grants rounds currently focus on. This ecosystem is supporting many open source software developers/orgs and creators who promote the building on or of Ethereum.

    The Ethereum ecosystem has also formed a split governance where the community multi-sig holders verify the work of GitcoinDAO as a check and balance. The GitcoinDAO is tasked with upholding the norms & values of the ecosystem.

  * Round Acceptance

    The rounds are specific time based instances of matching within an ecosystem. Each round includes all the grants allowed in the ecosystem hosting the round. GR10 is the Ethereum ecosystem round with matching from 6/16/21 - 7/1/21.

  * Sub-Round Acceptance

    A subset of grants allowed in the ecosystem and round which are eligible for a specific category of matching. \(May be inclusive or exclusive - Set by ecosystem\)

    In each quarterly grants round, the large matching pool is divided into sub-rounds. For example in GR10, the six sub-rounds were Infra Tech, dApp tech, Community, NFTs, dGov, LatAm.

  * Side-Round Acceptance

    A separate ecosystem using the hype of a larger round to promote an unrelated round. “Gitcoin Building Gitcoin” during GR10 - Funds for matching provided by Gitcoin Holdings, therefore they set the Ecosystem and Round participation policy.

    The GitcoinDAO stewards need to ratify the round per usual, but by identifying it as a "side-round" it notifies the explicit intent to piggyback on the larger ecosystem.

* Grant Participation Policy

  The current rules come from the [Gitcoin Holdings Inc. Terms of Service](https://gitcoin.co/legal/terms) and the established norms of the community. The next step in progressively decentralizing is to have the stewards of GitcoinDAO ratify the entirety of this policy.

  New grants are all reviewed prior to being activated on the platform. Grants are evaluated for both their platform eligibility and for participation in the rounds they select.

  **There are multiple levels for approval.**

  Platform \| Ecosystem \| Round \| Collection

  At each level, the participation policy allows for a subset of the grants at the higher level.

  * The Grant Approval Process

    Any user \(logged into Gitcoin using their Github credentials\) can create a new grant. The grant is visible to the community but not active in the round, and thus not eligible for matching funds. The Anti-Fraud & Collusion workstream of GitcoinDAO reviews each grant, approving or denying it. The verification process flow is below.

    [https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ra0AHoVKFZIAGlHxDJIQRKYMUr1i4rvYnLNUGqzUvqvLNTnkhjrgrlI-6irveqFsETmQdcRjyQ5CAzOi7RuJ2cdY4CXvlw5T38-WMqOyo8qCmANnt6IfkdSKXe9uPGqN12gfUyA](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ra0AHoVKFZIAGlHxDJIQRKYMUr1i4rvYnLNUGqzUvqvLNTnkhjrgrlI-6irveqFsETmQdcRjyQ5CAzOi7RuJ2cdY4CXvlw5T38-WMqOyo8qCmANnt6IfkdSKXe9uPGqN12gfUyA)

    In the past, the Gitcoin Team has sole review responsibility. For the first time in GR10 the community was incorporated into the verification process, along with a way for denied grants to appeal the community’s decision. For more information on grant activation and verification, [please read this article](https://support.gitcoin.co/kb/article/79-why-isn-t-my-grant-active/).

  * Platform Level Grant Participation Policy

    This policy is set and enforced by the Anti-Fraud & Collusion workstream of GitcoinDAO and is ratified by the GitcoinDAO stewards.

    * **Fraud \| Impersonation** - Claiming to be a brand or person you are not
    * **Hateful Content** - Racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful
    * **Deceiving Users** - Malicious content that could cause harm or unintended consequences to users
    * **Advertising** - Using grants to showcase something you are selling like a token sale or NFT drop

  * Ecosystem Level Grant Participation Policy

    All ecosystem policy is set by the contributors to the matching pool and/or the community the ecosystem serves. For the Gitcoin UI and ETH ecosystems this is entirely handled by the FDD workstream of GitcoinDAO. For side rounds like UNI, MATIC, or GTC, the FDD Workstream facilitates enforcement of policy set by the ecosystem hosting the side round.

    * Side Round Ecosystem Policy Documentation
      * Ethereum Ecosystem Participation Policy \(GR11, GR10, GR9, etc.\)

        All the Platform Participation Policy plus

        * Avoid any form of quid pro quo that has financial value \(a scenario in which a user gets some additional unique benefit/award in return for their donation\).
        * No non-ethereum related projects

          **Non Ethereum related projects**

          [https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FmA-OA4gmxHzekwzPCJXKoMXiF1YBlVs1BwAvl3-fjKlc3Gde\_R\_u4QiJ\_ZqTbOH8RlSZMBT0Aik3IYT8QtDXslQbiHhpCR0mUUcaYN\_fKochWyNPODRBBrYHn\_xvsvWNEaD0-s](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FmA-OA4gmxHzekwzPCJXKoMXiF1YBlVs1BwAvl3-fjKlc3Gde_R_u4QiJ_ZqTbOH8RlSZMBT0Aik3IYT8QtDXslQbiHhpCR0mUUcaYN_fKochWyNPODRBBrYHn_xvsvWNEaD0-s)

          Every round Non-Ethereum projects seek to participate. This includes Web3 groups on other chains. In GR9 we saw our first Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\) grant from an NFT project called [ARTSTRO](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2434/artstro).

          **Gitcoin Action:**

          In earlier rounds the precedent was set to not allow grants for projects outside of Ethereum, so we disabled this grant. But whether or not to permit other chains is an open governance question for the community.

        * No multiple grants for one entity in different categories

          **Project with Multiple Grants in Different Categories.**

          There was a [dispute](https://twitter.com/GitcoinDisputes/status/1372315090515415042) raised on March 17th, 2021 regarding two grants:

          * EtherDrops \(dApp Category\)
          * DropsEarn \(Community Category\)

          Both projects are affiliated with the DROPS Foundation.

          If the grants had been in the same category, then [pairwise bonding](https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553) would have muted the impact of both grants having similar contributors. But they were not.

          **Gitcoin Action:**

          The community went [back and forth with the founders of the DROPS Foundation](https://twitter.com/GitcoinDisputes/status/1372551235471958020), and ultimately decided that having similar grants from the same company dominating different categories with similar contributors, represented a threat to the legitimacy of the round. In response, the Gitcoin Team disabled matching on one \(but not both\) of the grants.

      * GitcoinDAO Ecosystem Participation Policy
      * All Exclusive Ecosystem Policy Documentation

        GTC - Gitcoin Building Gitcoin

        UNI - Uniswap

        * Matic Ecosystem Participation Policy
        * ZCash Ecosystem Participation Policy
        * Filecoin Ecosystem Participation Policy
        * Sia Ecosystem Participation Policy
        * Algorand Ecosystem Participation Policy
        * Binance Smart Chain Ecosystem Participation Policy

    There are two types of ecosystems:

    1. **Inclusive** - Grants must be approved to match the level policy, but defaults to inclusion.
    2. **Exclusive** - Grants must be explicitly invited by the ecosystem.

    As an example of an **INCLUSIVE** ecosystem, the Ethereum Ecosystem \| Round GR10 policy is ratified by the keyholders of the multi-sig wallet which holds the matching funds. The Ethereum ecosystem also uses the GitcoinDAO to set its policy.

    IINCLUSIVE - Anyone could make a grant and apply to The Gitcoin Building Gitcoin Ecosystem \| Side Round to GR10. However, participation policy was ratified by Gitcoin Holdings Inc., the sole contributor to the matching funds.

    EXCLUSIVE - The GR8 ZCash ecosystem side-round policy was invite only to grants which were explicitly invited to the round by the entity which controled the matching pool funds for that round. The same would apply for any other exclusive ecosystem\|round.

    * Round Participation Policy

      An ecosystem may decide to host a round with a different participation criteria than the ecosystem level policy. For example, the Ethereum ecosystem may want to do a round which only supports matching for projects building layer 2 infrastructure. This "collection" of grants would be a subset of the grants different than the ecosystem. \(This could be constrained to only allow ecosystem approved grants or it could be open to any other subset of grants on the platform.

      In this situation, the policy for the round would be ratified by the individual, org, multi-sig, or dao which controls the matching pool funds for that round.

  * Grants Disputes, Sanctions, and Appeals

    If a grant is denied, there is a chance that one of two things have happened.

    1. The judgement did not follow the policy and/or precedent.
    2. There is a novel situation which the current policy does not address.

    In the first situation, you will need evidence showing that the decision is made in error.

    For the second, you will need to clearly articulate your case.

    To get the process started you will need a steward who will back up your claim. You can ask for one in the discord, but DO NOT send them a dm! \(This could get you banned from the server\)

    Let us know about your situation in the [appeals-sanctions channel on Discord.](https://discord.gg/kdCRFsGt)

    This is a rough diagram of the appeal process. The staking amount is still to be determined and will be updated at that time. Stake is needed to deter spam.

* User Participation Policy

  The current rules come from the Gitcoin Holdings Inc. Terms of Service and the established norms of the community. The next step in progressively decentralizing is to have the stewards of GitcoinDAO ratify the entirety of this policy.

  Users are not reviewed upon activation on the platform. They are only reviewed when one of our detection mechanisms flags them as "presenting as fraudulent or sybil".

  Users in violation of the ToS or norms & values of an ecosystem may have their contributions effect on match allocations diminished or turned off. They may also be blocked from accessing the platform.

  **There are multiple levels for approval.**

  Platform \| Ecosystem \| Round \| Sub-Round \| Side-Round

  At each level, the participation policy allows for a subset of the users allowed at the higher level.

  **We cannot possibly enumerate every single literal example of a breaking of the above rule, so please treat the above list as an incomplete list. You should refer to the definitions of Sybil and collusion attack in the CLR paper as the canonical source of truth for the rules.**

  * Platform Level User Participation Policy

    This policy is set and enforced by the Anti-Fraud & Collusion workstream of GitcoinDAO and is ratified by the GitcoinDAO stewards.

    * **Fraud \| Impersonation** - Claiming to be a brand or person you are not. **DO NOT MAKE UP A NEW IDENTITY TO CONTRIBUTE**
    * **Hateful Content** - Racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful
    * **Deceiving Users** - Malicious content that could cause harm or unintended consequences to users
    * **Advertising** - Using grants to showcase something you are selling like a token sale or NFT drop
    * **Quid Pro Quo/Bribery** - DO NOT offer anyone a quid-pro-quo \(especially one that has financial value\) for a contribution.
    * **Falsification** - Any type of hacking to falsify a contribution is prohibited.

  * Ecosystem Level User Participation Policy

    This policy is set by the contributors to the matching pool and/or the community the ecosystem serves.

    Currently, the product has only built the tools to diminish or turn off matching for the Ethereum Ecosystem or at the platform level.

  * Ethereum Ecosystem User Participation Policy Documentation

    Same as the platform

  * Round User Participation Policy

    Round Participation is based on the settings for the ecosystem.

  * User Disputes, Sanctions, and Appeals

    There isn't currently a public oversight page for user sanctions due to PII data & potential vulnerabilities.

    The review of User sanctions is done by the ‣ workstream of GitcoinDAO.

    Any user may appeal their situation in the Gitcoin-Disputes Discord channel.

    **Gitcoin Dao reserves the right to deny service to anyone at anytime for any reason.**

* Understanding Potential Attack Vectors
  * Fraud/Impersonation

    **Attack**: In this example a user created a fraudulent grant impersonating [Lukso](https://gitcoin.co/grants/822/lukso-the-blockchain-for-new-digital-lifestyle). The Grant creation process does have several layers of fraud deterrent \(requiring manual review of each project, and requiring creators to submit a project website and Twitter handle\). In this case the malicious actor submitted a grant in Round 7 before a review process was in place, and was able to raise money until they were finally flagged by a community member.

    [https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G7OMn4K3OYARK2Rp1OX0mSE0o9aeBO9wh1\_iYA5CegF2J3w7Xo-SZoXswd1tCdt7ORqm0JObo\_N\_Kb4Kyho8KaMUtE9qrmMox4nHbWJTvElo7RUZ7h-TGWPR64u6mzcFWeXxKBY](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G7OMn4K3OYARK2Rp1OX0mSE0o9aeBO9wh1_iYA5CegF2J3w7Xo-SZoXswd1tCdt7ORqm0JObo_N_Kb4Kyho8KaMUtE9qrmMox4nHbWJTvElo7RUZ7h-TGWPR64u6mzcFWeXxKBY)

    **Gitcoin Action**: We were notified by a community member through @GitcoinDisputes that this is a fraudulent grant. We verified it as fraud with the project lead, and disabled it.

    * Hateful Content
    * Advertising
    * Ethereum Ecosystem
      * Understanding the community norms
    * Bribery/Quid Pro Quo

  * Collusion Attack

    We define collusion per the CLR Paper \( [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06421.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06421.pdf) \) as

    " The central vulnerabilities of LR, as with other mechanisms designed based on the assumption of unilateral optimization, are collusion and fraud. Collusion takes place when multiple agents act in their mutual interest to the detriment of other participants. Fraud takes place when a single citizen misrepresents herself as many. "

    [https://www.youtube.com/embed/yjHUPGA6ZZw](https://www.youtube.com/embed/yjHUPGA6ZZw)

  * Sybil Attack

    We define a Sybil attack \( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) \) per

    " In a Sybil attack, the attacker subverts the reputation system of a network service by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence. It is named after the subject of the book Sybil, a case study of a woman diagnosed with a dissociative identity disorder. "

    [https://www.youtube.com/embed/v1Dm7FI2AdU](https://www.youtube.com/embed/v1Dm7FI2AdU)

  * Bribery/Quid Pro Quo

    **Attack**: Blockchain technology offers unprecedented, decentralized transactional transparency, which is necessary for trustless coordination. But it can also lead to instances of bribery that could sway the QF algorithm to benefit a particular org. For example projects have promised token airdrops to users who have given to their grant. This is a form of quid pro quo in exchange for collusion to maximize their matching fund distribution, which is possible because send addresses are public.

    [https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FU9K8CWHLHMTQHY6kwldPxa6pPiJER9h1\_GWmfYq5GEwlWN26gBm\_MVLxrC6jJGy0ygIbol8sLjYvxQVFIJN0NnDjjrxb2n9pGA2NhlQ70gK1hEKu\_YlPerlHyKxJDb7vCcDJRo](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FU9K8CWHLHMTQHY6kwldPxa6pPiJER9h1_GWmfYq5GEwlWN26gBm_MVLxrC6jJGy0ygIbol8sLjYvxQVFIJN0NnDjjrxb2n9pGA2NhlQ70gK1hEKu_YlPerlHyKxJDb7vCcDJRo)

    However, not all airdrops are malicious. [In this example](https://docs.sato.trade/howtoget) an Ethereum project offered tokens for anyone who participated in Gitcoin Grants, no matter  which grants they funded. But regardless of the intent, this behavior also may cause unintended consequences. If airdrops for Gitcoin Grants participants become common, users may employ bots to donate a small amount to many grants in the hopes of token profits later on.

    It is worth noting that sometimes bribes are not explicitly offered, but can still be problematic even when they are implied, as is [the case with Minerva](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1110/minerva-wallet-lab10-collective-panvala-league). While not promising tokens, they do make a point to mention they will soon have one. It’s reasonable to believe they are implying that anyone participating in their grant now, will receive tokens in the future. This grey area is something we continue to work with the community stewards to define policy on.

    Another consideration is what effect bots donating might have on the quadratic funding mechanism. Sybil accounts using bots to donate to a collection of grants they think are most likely to offer a token airdrop would skew the payouts from the matching pool. A bot that donates evenly across all grants would not have this same effect.

    **Gitcoin Action**: In the case of an explicit bribe in which a quid-pro-quo is offered and a smoking gun evidence for the same is presented, we will take action to remove the grant from the matching pool.

    In cases in which bribes are not explicit, then we expect resolution will come through a formal community governance process.

    * Well-Funded Grants & Community Self Policing

    Grants Round 9 also presented an interesting concern that does not fall into an attack category, but did raise questions of legitimacy from the community. Maskbook is a fully funded Web3 project who sponsored the GR9 Hackathon. They released their token in February, 2021 which included a retroactive distribution to anyone who supported their grant in previous rounds.

    The controversial part of this is at the time Maskbook still had an active grant. So the community questioned whether or not it is appropriate for funded projects to participate in grants rounds and benefiting from QF matching, particularly if they had set a precedent for rewarding past grant contributors. In this case Maskbook acted quickly and stopped accepting matched funds, which seems in line with the expectations of the Ethereum community.

    Another example is [Vocdoni](https://twitter.com/vocdoni/status/1374415073666502667) who also had an active grant, but proactively stopped accepting funds from the match pool after their financial future was secured late last year.

    Both examples show the community was willing to police itself so that direct intervention from the Gitcoin Team was not necessary. This is an important observation to note. The more the community rewards good actors, and deters bad actors, the less the Gitcoin Team needs to be involved in governance decisions.

    **Gitcoin Action**:  In the case in which a grant owner decides to remove their grant from matching, we will do it for them.

    Right now there is no policy against grants having business models, token models, or VC fundraising, but in the future community stewards \(in cooperation with the Gitcoin community as a whole\) could create one if they wanted.
* Fraud Deterrent Mechanisms
  * Trustbonus

    **TrustBonus**

    **TrustBonus is designed to prevent sybil attacks by incentivizing identity verification**.

    This round Gitcoin supported BrightID, Proof of Humanity, Idena, ENS Twitter, POAP, SMS, and Google as optional identity verification techniques. When a user verified their identity on other platforms, they were given a

    [TrustBonus](http://gitcoin.co/trust)

    . The higher the Trust Bonus of a user is, the more we can be confident that the user is real. Higher TrustBonuses come with benefits such as higher

    [https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SsEizuKJuhYn31bauQGkf463wJmc0Z9We1L7kDapaLRYu7DaUvrqfBAk-\_-oe3dB02ZQinstaJYkBC0b94WwxImiv7fq1HdjF95kvHu7AwsrnnJ2jCkcgpmy7C0QdVS1cbj1qkU](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SsEizuKJuhYn31bauQGkf463wJmc0Z9We1L7kDapaLRYu7DaUvrqfBAk-_-oe3dB02ZQinstaJYkBC0b94WwxImiv7fq1HdjF95kvHu7AwsrnnJ2jCkcgpmy7C0QdVS1cbj1qkU)

    a match for grant contributions.

    [Read more about it here](https://gitcoin.co/blog/defending-quadratic-funding-in-grants-round-10-and-beyond/)

    .

    Given the increasing number of sybil attacks we’ve seen from round to round, we are strongly considering taking TrustBonus and Making it a TrustRequirement next round — users will not get any matching for their donations until they verify their identity on other platforms.

  * Identity Requirements

    Any contribution that can be converted to USDT will be matched during an active match round. It will be matched as from a new unique contributor provided

    1. It is from a new identity that has not contributed before.
    2. Identity requirements continue to evolve but for Round 5 a unique identity = a Github account that is older than the CLR round.
    3. Identity requirements are subject to the pretense that a contribution is not a Sybil attack or collusion.

  * Integration to DID

    We use aged Github accounts, SMS verification, BrightID, a few other undisclosed vectors, and \(soon\) Idena Network/ other DID solutions, as an identity solution for Gitcoin Grant contributions. Check out the trust tab of your profile to increase your trust level.

  * Pairwise Bounding

    **Pairwise Bounding**

    **Pairwise bounding is designed to proactively prevent collusion in QF.**

    Gitcoin has implemented pairwise bounding, which is a way of muting the impact of groups of contributors who contribute to the same grants as each other.  To learn more about pairwise bounding, check out

    [this post on ethresearch](https://ethresear.ch/t/pairwise-coordination-subsidies-a-new-quadratic-funding-design/5553)

    .

  * Minimum Donation

    Quadratic funding is exponentially vulnerable to attack from sybil accounts. Setting a minimum donation also creates a maximum damage level rather than being unbounded.
* Active Defense Measures
  * Sybil Detection by Machine Learning

    **Machine Learning Flagging & Community Review Process**

    **Our Machine Learning Flagging & Community Review Process is designed to prevent sybil attacks.**

    In addition to the proactive measures above, we have been working with BlockScience on a reactive machine learning pipeline that gives a score to each contribution, and informs the community stewards what contributions to look out for.

    BlockScience [has been posting on the Gitcoin blog](https://gitcoin.co/blog) with details about what they’ve been working on, and will be posting a blog post about this pipeline as it develops.
